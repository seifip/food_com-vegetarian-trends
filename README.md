# Vegetarian trends at food.com
The interest in vegetarian and vegan food has grown steadily over the past two decades.

The number of searches for 'veganism' in the UK has increased 900% from 2009 to 2019.[2]

And although in 2015, just 3.4% of all Americans said they were vegetarian, fully a quarter of 25- to 34-year-olds identified as such.[1]

Below, I will explore whether this vegetarian trend extends to the users of [food.com](https://www.food.com/), one of the leading online recipe websites.
